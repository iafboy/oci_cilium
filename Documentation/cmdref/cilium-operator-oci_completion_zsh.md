## cilium-operator-oci completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(cilium-operator-oci completion zsh); compdef _cilium-operator-oci cilium-operator-oci

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	cilium-operator-oci completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_cilium-operator-oci"

#### macOS:

	cilium-operator-oci completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_cilium-operator-oci

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
cilium-operator-oci completion zsh [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```
